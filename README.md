# Every Gambit

This is catalogue of every gambit in the game of chess according to the wikipedia page [List of chess gambits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_chess_gambits).

It was generated by scraping the wikipedia page and extracting the gambits from the tables. I am including the code that was used to generate the list in the repository, along with the generated pgn file.

## Bonus: Kings Gambit by Spassky

Boris Spassky famously won in the King's Gambit in the 1972 World Chess Championship against Bobby Fischer. Even more impressively, he never lost a game with it, despite fearlessly employing it against many of the era's best players. I have included all of Spassky's games in the King's Gambit, and consolidated them from several games, into a single game with the games portrayed as variations on the main gambit line. There is also, of course, the python code used to consolidate them.
